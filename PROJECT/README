SYED SHAHEER ALI 64291:
In Working since 3 4 days, we got so many results, ups and downs in accuracy, hanging of laptop, burning heat of laptop, etc. After 7 to 8 predictions submitted we got the result as shown in the pictures. What is good about SVM?
MODEL: SVM generally do not suffer condition of overfitting and performs well when there is a clear indication of separation between classes. SVM can be used when total no of samples is less than the no of dimensions and performs well in terms of memory. SVM performs and generalized well on the out of sample data.
**Some Main problem**
Laptop got hanged, and still on updating mode.

PROBLEM:
in my model I  faced the  problem in the data cleaning sets beacuse it take time to upload the datasets by which laptop beacame hang
and in column 27 there is data of alphabets and we donot need this data . after  assignment 3 my Accuracy was not good  so after 
by using more date cleaning techniques my final accuracy is 0.62538 

Ezhar karim 63604  KNN algorithm 
Concepts:
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well 
as regression predictive problems. However, 
it is mainly used for classification predictive problems in industry. The following two properties would define KNN well −
Lazy learning algorithm − KNN is a lazy learning algorithm because it does not have a specialized training phase and uses 
all the data for training while classification.
Non-parametric learning algorithm − KNN is also a non-parametric learning algorithm because it doesn’t assume anything about the underlying data.
PROBLEM:
It will take so much time in Debuging.
